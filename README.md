# Rosalind

Rosalind, http://rosalind.info/about, is a website devoted to teaching bioinformatics through computational problems. 
This repository contains my code and approach to solving these problems. The two folders, Stronghold and Algorithm, contain solutions to two types of questions found on rosalind's website. The files found in the Stronghold directory answer questions about the underlying algorithms of many bioinformatic problems. The files in the Algorithm directory answer questions using existing programs and tools. Some of these tools include biopython and other code libraries, while others use web and other applications accessed through bash.
